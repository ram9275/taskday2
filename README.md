ML model training Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Iâ€™ve learned how to thoroughly understand datasets before jumping into modeling. Boxplots helped me spot outliers and distributions, while correlation analysis showed relationships between features, highlighting potential multicollinearity that could affect predictions. Detecting skewness in data was key for ensuring balanced distributions, and I saw how scaling might be necessary for better model performance. Using tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, I refined my approach to visualizing trends, identifying anomalies, and making data-driven decisions. EDA has repeatedly helped me uncover missing values, unexpected patterns, and feature dependencies, guiding me toward better preprocessing strategies. Now, I see how visualization plays a crucial role in machine learning by improving interpretability and ensuring meaningful insights before model building. This structured analysis has sharpened my ability to detect issues early and refine data for impactful results
